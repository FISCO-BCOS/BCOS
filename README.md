FISCO BCOS is the first safe and controllable enterprise-level financial consortium blockchain platform open source by domestic enterprises. It is jointly created by the FISCO open source working group and officially launched in December 2017.

In a single-chain configuration, the performance TPS can reach 10,000. FISCO BCOS Provides many features such as group architecture, parallel computing, distributed storage, pluggable consensus mechanism, privacy protection algorithm, and support for fully supporting the OSCCA-approved cryptography algorithm. After a long period of practical testing in the production environment by multiple institutions and multiple applications, it has financial-grade high performance, high availability and high security.

FISCO BCOS 3.0 is a brand new upgrade, adding multiple core features, mainly as follows:

- **Microservice Architecture**: The modular design architecture of microservices supports independent and parallel expansion of computing, storage, and network.

- **Deterministic multi-contract parallel algorithm**: The user-insensitive intelligent parallel scheduling engine can achieve contract-level parallelism and greatly increase transaction throughput.

- **Pipeline PBFT consensus mechanism**: A new upgrade and revision of PBFT to realize block packaging, verification, and consensus pipeline services, which significantly improves system efficiency.

- **Integration of WeBankBlockchain Liquid and WASM virtual machine**: While supporting Solidity, it also supports WeBankBlockchain Liquid contract, which makes the contract more powerful

- **Blockchain File System**: Supports the "what you see is what you get" blockchain resource management method, which is more friendly to blockchain contracts and data governance.

- **Multi-scene adaptable product family**: Supports the construction of different service models, including "light Air version", "professional Pro version" and "large-capacity Max version" to meet the needs of diversified scenarios.
