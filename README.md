**FISCO BCOS** officially launched in December 2017, is the first China-developed open source consortium blockchain platform. It was collaboratively built by the FISCO open source working group, which was formed by Beyondsoft, Huawei, Shenzhen Securities Communications, Digital China, Forms Syntron, Tencent, WeBank, YIBI Technology, Yuexiu Financial Holdings (Fintech) and more.

Aiming for business adaptability, performance, security, technical applicability, O&M and costs, FISCO BCOS opted for a consortium chain architecture that has achieved over 10,000 TPS of single-chain performance and massive storage capability. It supports both PBFT and Raft algorithms for block consensus. It provides portable tools to allow developers to configure and deploy new FISCO BCOS instances in seconds. Applications can be easily developed based on smart contracts and case templates; business security and privacy is guaranteed by access control, cryptography, privacy protection, and other sophisticated technologies.

FISCO BCOS is a reliable, secure, efficient and portable blockchain platform with proven success from many partners and successful financial-grade applications. Till now, hundreds and thousands of companies, institutions and individual contributors have launched their own applications based on FISCO BCOS, covering application scenarios including government affairs, finance, charity, health care, education, transport, copyright, product tracing, supply chain, recruitment, agriculture, social communication, and entertainment.
